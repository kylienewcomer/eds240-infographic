# Investigating Fish Distribution Under Kelp Canopy in the Channel Islands

![](images/GPTempDownload.jpg)

## Goal

This project aims to visualize the distribution of fish in the water column under varying densities of kelp canopy cover throughout the Northern Channel Islands. Fish biodiversity and biomass will be assessed at three distinct layers of the water column (bottom, midwater, and canopy) under varying densities of Giant Kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera).

## Data

The data for this project comes from the long-term MPA monitoring project by the Caselle Lab of University California, Santa Barbara. More information about the MPA monitoring project and metadata can be found [here](https://search.dataone.org/view/doi%3A10.25494%2FP6%2FMLPA_kelpforest.10). Data comes directly from the researchers via Google Drive and is not yet publicly available.
