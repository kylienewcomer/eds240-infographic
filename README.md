# Investigating Fish Distribution Under Kelp Canopy in the Channel Islands

## Purpose
This project aims to visualize the distribution of fish in the water column under varying densities of kelp canopy cover throughout the Northern Channel Islands. Fish biodiverity and biomass will be assessed at three distinct layers of the water column (bottom, midwater, and canopy) under varying densities of Giant Kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera).
